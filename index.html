            I am a driven developer who loves learning new things and expanding
            this new toolset I have found to make my mark within a development
            team. I embrace the challenges that development has to offer and
            love the abundance of everchanging languages and techniques that are
            out there to explore.

                  THis was a project with the goal of setting up a game like
                  application where we connected to many API's. We set it up in
                  that a user would have to give a pitch in applying for a job
                  that was randomly provided using a word that was also randomly
                  generated. This post could then get comments and likes and
                  then could be upvoted or downvoted as was applicable.

                  This applicaition we developed in a group environment using
                  the scrum methods in a week long project with the goal being
                  to hav ea login page, a plage where users could create
                  practice quizzes and then take quizzes that had already been
                  created. Once we reached this we added a profile page and then
                  started playing with sockets to create a one on one chat rooms
                  where one could do realtime practice interviews.

                  Pnister was an application where the user could log in and
                  then create keeps and store them in vaults that they had
                  created. Users could also set keeps to pricvate or not, and
                  each keep had the functionality so that it could be counted on
                  the amount of times it had been viewd or kept.
